/*

A node that checks the relative distance between turtle1 and turtle2 and:
- publish on a topic the distance (you can use a std_msgs/Float32 for
that)
- stops the moving turtle if the two turtles are “too close” (you may
set a threshold to monitor that)
- stops the moving turtle if the position is too close to the boundaries
